Virtual and Physical memory are usually different.
Physical refers to hardware addresses. Like numbers near the bookshelf, where we can store books.
Virtual memory refers to the virtual memory, like a dns. Process ask for the information in that concrete shelf,
but don't really know, where this shelf is placed. Virtual address is translated to the physical adress and gives 
to the process access to the shelf.
