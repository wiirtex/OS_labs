In different situations we can see some deadlock situations.

Some examples of me running my program (ex3.c):

1)

Start program
Creating processes
producer starts
consumer starts
producer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep


/*here is deadlock*/

2)

Start program
Creating processes
consumer starts
consumer starts to sleep
producer starts
producer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
producer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
producer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
producer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
producer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
producer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
producer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
producer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
producer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
producer finishes

/*and then deadlock*/

3)

Start program
Creating processes
consumer starts
consumer starts to sleep
producer starts
consumer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep
producer starts to sleep
consumer starts to sleep


/*and then deadlock*/


These deadlocks appears because of uncontrolled usage of conditions variables and the buffer.
